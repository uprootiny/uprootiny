### Computational Mathematician & LLM Infrastructure Engineering

> "Precision, pattern, and possibility — folded into code."

We design systems at the intersection of mathematical modeling, machine learning infrastructure, and cloud architecture. My work focuses on building robust, composable tools that bridge theoretical foundations with practical implementation.

## 🔬 Expertise

```clojure
(def specializations
  {:computational-methods ["Statistical Modeling" "Non-Bayesian Inference" "Causal Analysis"]
   :llm-infrastructure    ["Inference Optimization" "Fine-tuning Pipelines" "Traceable Systems"]
   :system-design         ["Low-coupling" "Observable" "Composition-first"]})
